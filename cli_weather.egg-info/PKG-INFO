        ## Support The Project :sparkling_heart:
        
        I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
        this takes time. You can use this service for free.
        
        However, if you are using this project and happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it :-
        
        - Starring and sharing the project :rocket:
        - You can donation via BuyMeACoffee. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
